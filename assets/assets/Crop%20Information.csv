Maize,,Temperatures between 15°C to 35°C. Full sunlight and well drained soil.,"Soil Type: Maize grows best in well-drained soils with good water-holding capacity. It thrives in loamy or sandy loam soils. Avoid heavy clay soils that can become waterlogged.
Soil pH: Maize prefers a slightly acidic to neutral soil pH range of 5.8 to 7.0. Adequate soil pH helps with nutrient availability and uptake.",Moderate water requirements with Adquate irrigation during flowering and grain filling,Approximately 90 - 120 days depending on the variety,"Stem borers, Armyworms, Maize weevils. ","Maize rust, Gray leaf spot, maize smut","Nirogen, Phosphorus and Potassium fertilizers for optimal growth."
Beans,,Warm Climate with Temperatures between 21°C and 27°C,"Soil Type: Beans prefer well-drained soils with good organic matter content. They grow well in loamy or sandy loam soils. Avoid heavy clay soils that can retain excess moisture.
Soil pH: Beans thrive in a slightly acidic to neutral soil pH range of 6.0 to 7.5. Maintaining appropriate pH levels ensures optimal nutrient availability.",Moderate water requirements with adequate soil moisture during flowering and pod development stages.,Generally 60 to 90 days depending on the variety.,"Aphids, Leafhoppers, Bean beetles. ","Bacterial blight, powdery mildew and anthracnose.",Sufficient phosphorus and potassium. Crop rotation practices with leguminous plants to improve soil fertility.
Matooke,,Tropical climates with temperatures between 25°C and 35°C,"Soil Type: Matooke grows well in deep, well-drained soils with good water-holding capacity. It prefers loamy soils rich in organic matter. Avoid poorly drained or waterlogged soils.
Soil pH: Matooke thrives in slightly acidic to neutral soil pH ranging from 6.0 to 7.0. Maintaining appropriate pH levels is important for nutrient uptake.",Regular watering during dry season to moist the soil.,About 9 to 12 months from planting to harvest.,"Banana weevils, Aphids, Nematodes.","Banana bacterial wilt, fusarium wilt, black Sigatoks","Balanced supply of Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and micronutrients with regular fertilization mostly organic."
Coffee,,Tropical climates with temperatures between 15°C and 24°C. Well distributed rainfall and altitudes ranging from 2000 to 6000ft,"Soil Type: Coffee prefers well-drained, fertile soils with good water-holding capacity. Sandy loam or loam soils with good organic matter content are ideal. Avoid heavy clay or poorly drained soils.
Soil pH: Coffee plants prefer slightly acidic to neutral soil pH ranging from 6.0 to 6.5. Maintaining the right pH level aids in nutrient availability and enhances plant growth.",Regular and consistent moisture. Adequate rainfall or irrigation especially during flowering and fruit development stages.,Approximately 3 to 4 years for a newly planted coffee to start bearing fruits.,"Coffee berry, borers, coffee leaf miners, nematodes","Coffee rust, coffee leaf rust","Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium. Soil fertility management and proper fertilization practices are important."
Tea,,"Tea plants thrive in regions with cool to warm climates. They prefer temperatures between 65°F (18°C) and 85°F (29°C). Tea cultivation is commonly done at altitudes ranging from sea level to around 7,000 feet.","Soil Type: Tea grows well in well-drained, fertile soils with good water-holding capacity. Sandy loam, loam, or clay loam soils with good organic matter content are suitable.
Soil pH: Tea plants prefer slightly acidic to neutral soil pH ranging from 5.5 to 6.5. Maintaining appropriate pH levels aids in nutrient absorption.",Tea plants require regular and evenly distributed rainfall or irrigation. Adequate moisture is crucial for leaf growth and quality.,"Tea plants can be harvested for leaves after about 3-4 years of establishment. They undergo repeated flushes of growth, with young leaves being plucked for tea production at regular intervals.","Common pests for tea include tea mosquitoes, tea loopers, and red spider mites. ","Diseases such as tea blister blight, gray blight, and orange rust can also affect the crop.","Tea plants require essential nutrients, including nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Soil testing and appropriate fertilization practices are important for maintaining soil fertility."
Cotton,,Cotton thrives in warm climates with temperatures between 60°F (15°C) and 95°F (35°C). It requires a frost-free growing season of about 160-180 days and well-drained soil.,"Soil Type: Cotton prefers well-drained soils with good water-holding capacity. Sandy loam, loam, or silt loam soils are suitable. Avoid heavy clay soils that may restrict root development.
Soil pH: Cotton grows best in a slightly acidic to slightly alkaline soil pH range of 6.0 to 7.8. Maintaining appropriate pH levels helps with nutrient availability and uptake.","Cotton has moderate water requirements. Adequate soil moisture during key growth stages, such as flowering and boll development, is important.","Cotton has a life cycle of approximately 5-6 months. It goes through stages like germination, seedling growth, vegetative growth, flowering, boll formation, and maturation.","Common pests for cotton include bollworms, aphids, and whiteflies","Diseases such as cotton leaf curl virus, bacterial blight, and fusarium wilt can also affect the crop.","Cotton plants require nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, along with other micronutrients. Soil fertility management and proper fertilization practices are important for optimal growth"
